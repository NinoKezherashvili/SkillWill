          scarf. He had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out
          beyond the brim of his hat." —The Fellowship of the Ring, "A

        Gandalf, known temporarily as the Grey and later the White, and
        originally named Olórin (Quenya), was an Istar (Wizard), dispatched to
        Middle-earth in the Third Age to combat the threat of Sauron. He joined
        Thorin II Oakenshield and his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain
        from Smaug, helped form the Fellowship of the Ring to destroy the One
        Ring, and led the Free Peoples in the final campaign of the War of the
        Ring.Í

      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar.
        He was created by Ilúvatar before the Music of the Ainur[1], and was at
        the beginning of Time amongst the Ainur who entered into Eä.[2] In his
        "youth" he became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo, and
        Nienna. He was associated with light and fire, much like Varda[3], yet
        his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and
        patience. He loved the Elves, but walked unseen among them, or wore the
        guise of an Elf, and sent them fair visions in their hearts that made
        them wiser. Throughout his life he followed the example of Nienna,
        talking pity on the sorrows of the Children of Ilúvatar and drawing
        those who listened to him out of despair.[3] When the Valar decided to
        send the Istari (also called Wizards) to Middle-earth to counsel and
        assist all those who opposed the Dark Lord Sauron, Manwë and Varda
        included Olórin among the five to be sent. At first, Olórin was nervous
        and described himself as too weak and afraid of Sauron. Manwë
        understood, and told Olórin that such was a reason why he should go, to
        overcome that fear. Furthermore, the One Ring, containing much of
        Sauron's power, presumably still existed somewhere. Thus, Manwë insisted
        that Olórin should go as the third, but Varda convinced him to send
        Olórin as the second instead.[4] He agreed, and prepared for Olórin's
        departure from the Undying Lands with the other four, arriving about the
        same time that the Necromancer appeared in Mirkwood.

      <h2>Quest of Erebor</h2>
      <p>
        Over the years, Gandalf became concerned about the weak state of the
        North. Smaug the dragon had destroyed both the Kingdom under the
        Mountain and the town of Dale, and the wizard feared that Sauron might
        use the desolation around Erebor to regain the northern passes in the
        mountains and the old lands of Angmar. Gandalf knew that exiled Dwarf
        King of Durin's Folk, Thorin II Oakenshield, planned to battle against
        Smaug, but he knew that it would not be enough. In TA 2941,[5] while
        staying the night in Bree, Gandalf happened across the Dwarf King.[8]
        Thorin initiated conversation; he had been having a strange feeling
        urging him to seek Gandalf. The same was intrigued, for he had thought
        to seek Thorin as well. They found they were taking the same road for a
        while (Thorin passing through the Shire on his way to the Ered Luin),
        and they agreed to travel together. Thorin wanted advice, and Gandalf in
        turn wanted to discuss the dragon Smaug with Thorin. Ultimately, Gandalf
        concocted a plan wherein Thorin could destroy Smaug and recover his
        family fortune, albeit with a "burglar" of Gandalf's own choosing.
